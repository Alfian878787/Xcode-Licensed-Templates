Xcode Licensed Templates
------------------------

**Minimal Xcode Templates for Open Source Developers**

Xcode means well with all of its file templates and autocomplete fanciness. But more often than not, it just gets in the way, and generates dozens of lines of code that you'll delete anyway. 

These templates start your code off on the right foot: attribution and license in the header, followed by import statements and `@interface` / `@implementation`.

Select from your favorite open source licenses to be embedded in the header:

- [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license)
- [Apache 2.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
- [BSD 3-Clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)
- [Zlib](http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib)
- [The Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/)
